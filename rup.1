rup \- remote uptime display
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrup\fP [ \fIhost\fP | -u | -v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrup\fP displays a summary of the current status of a  particular 
host or all hosts on the local network.
.br
The output shows how long the system has been up, the number of
users currently on the system (if the system is running the current
version of \fBrpc.rstatd(8)\fP), and the load  averages.
.br
The load average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue 
averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes. 
.br
The \fBrpc.rstatd(8)\fP daemon must be running on the remote host 
for this command to work.
.br
